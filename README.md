Cattle-Identification is a machine learning project designed to identify and recognize individual cattle using computer vision and embedding techniques. The project includes model training, embedding generation, and a web application interface for cattle identification. It uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity matching and provides both a Jupyter notebook for experimentation and a Python application for deployment.

### Main Function Points
- Cattle individual identification and recognition system
- Embedding generation and storage for cattle identification
- FAISS-based similarity search for efficient cattle matching
- Web application interface (Flask-based app.py) for user interaction
- Jupyter notebook for model development and experimentation
- Pre-trained embeddings and FAISS index for inference

### Technology Stack
- Python (primary language)
- Jupyter Notebook (experimentation and development)
- Flask or similar web framework (app.py)
- FAISS (Similarity search library)
- NumPy (data processing and embedding storage)
- Deep Learning/Computer Vision libraries (for embedding generation)
